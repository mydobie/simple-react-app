### Javascript

Because React applications are built using Javascript, the following sites are recommended to practice Javascript (and many other language) by fun challenges:

- [Code Signal](https://app.codesignal.com/login) - Look for the "Daily Challenge" and "Arcade" sections
- [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) - Pick your language and start with the challenges (note the easier challenges have a higher kyu number)
